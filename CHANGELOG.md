## [4.1.2] - 2023-11-06
### Fixed
- Some configuration flags weren't being set in 4.1.1 for 2022.3 only, causing some runtime features to not be enabled correctly. This has been fixed and only affected that specific version combination

## [4.1.1] - 2023-09-05
### Added
- Added Quest 3 target device checkbox
- Updated the `SystemHeadset` enum to include `Meta_Quest_3` and `Meta_Link_Quest_3` entries

### Changed
- Added project validation rule and soft dependency to xr.core.utils package
- Bumped up required XR Management version to 4.4.0 to fix issues with Android Manifest cleanup
- Updated Oculus plugins to v56
- Updated documentation to inform users that Phase Sync is always active when using the Oculus OpenXR Runtime
- Bumped minimum Unity version from 2022.2 to 2022.3

### Fixed
- Removed Android manifest cleanup that removed the manifest file, existing projects need to do a clean build to completely remove the issue
- Fixed Android app issues that arise when setting the entry point to GameActivity

### Known Issues
- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.PerfMetrics` entries currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime
- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.AppMetrics` entries return `0` on all Oculus runtimes
- For both of the above, the suggested replacement is to use the profiling tools available via the Oculus Developer Hub: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh-logs-metrics/

## [4.0.0] - 2023-04-24
### Changed

## [3.3.0] - 2023-03-13
### Added
- Updated the `SystemHeadset` enum to include `Meta_Quest_Pro` and `Meta_Link_Quest_Pro` entries

### Changed
- Modified how foveated rendering (ETFR and FFR) is enabled and configured from script to make it more consistent

### Fixed
- Reverted deferred eye texture deletion as we only needed to defer layer deletion
- Fixed a GLES2 script deprecation warning in Unity 2023.1+

## [3.2.3] - 2023-02-16
### Changed
- No changes from 3.2.3-pre.1 other than removing the Pre-release version tag

## [3.2.3-pre.1] - 2023-02-08
### Fixed
- Fixed a potential memory corruption issue on Rift when calculating mirror view rects
- Issue where enabling mobile Depth Submission could cause crashes on application startup if MSAA was disabled. The problem was fixed in Unity 2020.3 and above. To get the fix, install the latest patch release of whichever Unity version you are using
- Resolved an issue where disconnecting a Link device then reconnecting it could result in a black screen with no input
- Resolved a potential issue where read-only System Splash Screen images could cause build failures
- Fixed a potential startup crash on Quest when app initialization is interrupted and then resumed

## [3.2.2] - 2022-11-06
### Changed
- No changes from 3.2.2-pre.2 other than removing the Pre-release version tag

## [3.2.2-pre.2] - 2022-11-03
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where Eye Tracked Foveated Rendering settings may conflict with settings provided by the Oculus Integration asset
- `Shared Depth Buffer` on PC should now work correctly when using `Single Pass Instanced` rendering
- Fixed potential jittering and one frame delay when using dynamic render viewports
- Fixed incorrect vertical placement of viewports when using Vulkan

## [3.2.2-pre.1] - 2022-10-24
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where `OnPostprocessBuild()` could log warnings in situations where the Oculus Android provider wasn't enabled in XR Management
- Resolved an issue where eye textures and layers were being destroyed too early when being reallocated, potentially resulting in GPU hangs/faults

## [3.2.1] - 2022-10-04
### Added
- Eye Tracked Foveated Rendering for Quest Pro. Requires Vulkan and Multiview
- Depth submission for mobile Oculus platforms. Allows for depth testing between layers
- Added a setting to add Quest Pro support to the Android manifest

### Changed
- Updated Oculus plugins to v46 with the OpenXR backend

## [3.1.1] - 2022-08-24
### Changed
- Bumped minimum Unity version to 2021.3.4f1
- Added version detection checks to validate compatibility with specific Unity versions

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where an XR Rig could cause constant attempts to set the tracking origin when using the OpenXR backend, causing potential visual issues and/or crashes. **Note:** This fix will cause `TryRecenter()` to always return `true`. If you have an application that depends on the results of `TryRecenter()`, please note this behavior change.  `TryRecenter()` would only work correctly on PC non-OpenXR builds in previous versions, and would return `false` in all other situations

## [3.1.0-pre.1] - 2022-06-23
### Added
- Added the `Enable TrackingOrigin Stage Mode` option to mobile settings. When enabled, if the Tracking Origin Mode is set to Floor, the tracking origin won't change with a system recenter

### Changed
- Updated Oculus plugins to v41 with the OpenXR backend (Mac spatializer plugin is still on v34)

### Fixed
- A few refresh rate issues with Rift and available refresh rate reporting on Quest have been resolved with the v41 plugin update
- Fixed an issue where playing in editor via Link was not functioning correctly when Application SpaceWarp was enabled

## [3.0.2] - 2022-06-01
### Fixed
- Fixed an incorrect depth texture format being requested on mobile
- Fixed compilation errors on platforms where `ENABLE_VR` is not currently defined
- Fixed an issue where the mirror view blit was using an incorrect source rect
- Early engine init on mobile now looks for a boot.config entry rather than using an intent filter query, resolving potential Android app store issues

## [3.0.1] - 2022-03-30
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where Symmetric Projection was defaulting to off, not taking advantage of potential GPU perf gains
- Changed Symmetric Projection and Subsampled Layout settings incompatibilities to be build warnings rather than errors since these aren't fatal settings issues

## [3.0.0] - 2022-03-02
### Added
- Added a Late Latching Debug Mode option under the Experimental section of the Oculus Android settings. This can be used to verify that Late Latching is working as intended via log entries in Development builds. Currently requires Unity 2020.3.28f1 or higher, and will be available in a future release of 2021.2+
- Add optional support for Symmetric Projection on Quest 2 when using Vulkan and Multiview. This can improve GPU performance when using Multiview due to more common workloads between the left and right eye

### Changed
- Multiview (Quest), and Single Pass Instanced (PC) are now the default stereo rendering modes in Unity 2021.2 and higher

### Fixed
- Android Minimum API Level was always being forced to 23 when Oculus Android was enabled. Now it's only set to 23 if it's currently less than 23

## [3.0.0-pre.4] - 2022-01-24
### Fixed

- Changed how init code finds the Unity Surface View to fix an issue related to recent core engine changes

## [3.0.0-pre.1] - 2021-10-22
### Added
- Added support for Application SpaceWarp to enable smoother experiences at lower framerates. **Note:** This feature currently requires a customized version of the URP package that is provided by Oculus. You shouldn't enable this feature if you aren't using that custom URP package
- Added experimental support for Late Latching when using Vulkan on Quest devices

### Changed
- Updated Oculus plugins to v33 with the OpenXR backend.  **Note:** Gamma color space is no longer supported with GLES with the OpenXR backend, so projects need to use linear color space, or switch to Vulkan. Users on 2020.3 can continue to use the verified 1.x.y versions of this package if they don't wish to update to the OpenXR backend
- Bumped minimum Unity version to 2021.2.0b17
- Changed `SetFoveationLevel(int level)` to return a bool.  FFR APIs should succeed on mobile and fail on desktop
- Removed package dependency on `com.unity.ugui`

### Added

### Fixed
- Fixed issue #1325113, where hand tracking was not working on Quest/Quest 2 when the Unity splash screen was disabled

## [1.9.0-preview.1] - 2021-03-15
### Added
- Added `bool EnableDynamicFFR(bool enable)` to enable dynamic FFR.  This should be combined with `SetFoveationLevel()` to enable dynamic FFR

- Added Unity Profiler marker for `OculusRuntime.WaitToBeginFrame` to clarify time spent waiting for frame sync. Note that this marker is only visible in Unity 2020.1+ since the profiler plugin interface is not available in 2019.4
