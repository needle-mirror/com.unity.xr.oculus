All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.5.1] - 2025-03-03
### Fixed
- Fixed warnings and errors related to using Direct3D 12
- Automatically disable Direct3D 12 when the Oculus XR Plugin is enabled on Windows in Unity 6.1 and higher

### Known Issues
- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.PerfMetrics` entries currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime
- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.AppMetrics` entries return `0` on all Oculus runtimes
- For both of the above, the suggested replacement is to use the profiling tools available via the Oculus Developer Hub: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh-logs-metrics/
- `Acceleration` and `AngularAcceleration` values on tracked poses currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime.  This is a limitation of the OpenXR API

## [4.5.0] - 2024-12-11
### Added
- Added Optimize Multiview Render Regions setting for Meta Quest devices. Multiview Render Regions enables the GPU to skip shader invocations (and rendering work) for screen areas outside of the user's view. Requires Vulkan and Multiview

### Changed
- Reorient position delta of SpaceWarp's app space delta position to be relative to the current view space
- Changed build process to keep Bluetooth permissions tag if present in the manifest

- Fixed an issue where headtracking would get desynced after switching from Game view to Scene view when using Meta Quest Link

## [4.4.0] - 2024-09-26
### Added
- Added Quest 3S target device checkbox
- Updated the `SystemHeadset` enum to include `Meta_Quest_3S` and `Meta_Link_Quest_3S` entries

## [4.3.0] - 2024-07-30
### Added
- Added support for Unity's new common Foveated Rendering API, with improved URP support
- Added option to Oculus settings to activate support for Stick Control thumbsticks instead of Vector2 Control, which allows a greater range of usages, such as a D-Pad and independent buttons. When activating this feature, the define `META_USE_STICK_CONTROL_THUMBSTICKS` will be added in Scripting Define Symbols under Player Settings. Note that this feature requires at minimum the Input System package version 1.6.2 included in the project

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where an XR Rig could cause constant attempts to set the tracking origin when using the OpenXR backend, causing potential visual issues and/or crashes. **Note:** This fix will cause `TryRecenter()` to always return `true`. If you have an application that depends on the results of `TryRecenter()`, please note this behavior change.  `TryRecenter()` would only work correctly on PC non-OpenXR builds in previous versions, and would return `false` in all other situations

## [3.1.0-pre.1] - 2022-06-23
### Added
- Added the `Enable TrackingOrigin Stage Mode` option to mobile settings. When enabled, if the Tracking Origin Mode is set to Floor, the tracking origin won't change with a system recenter

### Fixed
- Fixed an incorrect depth texture format being requested on mobile
- Fixed compilation errors on platforms where `ENABLE_VR` is not currently defined
- Fixed an issue where the mirror view blit was using an incorrect source rect
- Early engine init on mobile now looks for a boot.config entry rather than using an intent filter query, resolving potential Android app store issues

## [3.0.1] - 2022-03-30
### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where Symmetric Projection was defaulting to off, not taking advantage of potential GPU perf gains
- Changed Symmetric Projection and Subsampled Layout settings incompatibilities to be build warnings rather than errors since these aren't fatal settings issues

## [3.0.0] - 2022-03-02
### Added
- Added a Late Latching Debug Mode option under the Experimental section of the Oculus Android settings. This can be used to verify that Late Latching is working as intended via log entries in Development builds. Currently requires Unity 2020.3.28f1 or higher, and will be available in a future release of 2021.2+
- Add optional support for Symmetric Projection on Quest 2 when using Vulkan and Multiview. This can improve GPU performance when using Multiview due to more common workloads between the left and right eye

### Changed
- Multiview (Quest), and Single Pass Instanced (PC) are now the default stereo rendering modes in Unity 2021.2 and higher

### Fixed
- Android Minimum API Level was always being forced to 23 when Oculus Android was enabled. Now it's only set to 23 if it's currently less than 23

### Added
- Added support for Application SpaceWarp to enable smoother experiences at lower framerates. **Note:** This feature currently requires a customized version of the URP package that is provided by Oculus. You shouldn't enable this feature if you aren't using that custom URP package
- Added experimental support for Late Latching when using Vulkan on Quest devices

### Changed
- Updated Oculus plugins to v33 with the OpenXR backend.  **Note:** Gamma color space is no longer supported with GLES with the OpenXR backend, so projects need to use linear color space, or switch to Vulkan. Users on 2020.3 can continue to use the verified 1.x.y versions of this package if they don't wish to update to the OpenXR backend
- Bumped minimum Unity version to 2021.2.0b17
- Changed `SetFoveationLevel(int level)` to return a bool.  FFR APIs should succeed on mobile and fail on desktop
- Removed package dependency on `com.unity.ugui`
