    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added support for Unity's new common Foveated Rendering API, with improved URP support\n- Added option to Oculus settings to activate support for Stick Control thumbsticks instead of Vector2 Control, which allows a greater range of usages, such as a D-Pad and independent buttons. When activating this feature, the define `META_USE_STICK_CONTROL_THUMBSTICKS` will be added in Scripting Define Symbols under Player Settings. Note that this feature requires at minimum the Input System package version 1.6.2 included in the project\n\n### Changed\n- Improved Symmetric Projection texture resolution calculations\n- Removed legacy code no longer needed in currently supported versions of Unity\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue with eye poses being incorrect in certain situations\n\n### Known Issues\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.PerfMetrics` entries currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.AppMetrics` entries return `0` on all Oculus runtimes\n- For both of the above, the suggested replacement is to use the profiling tools available via the Oculus Developer Hub: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh-logs-metrics/\n- `Acceleration` and `AngularAcceleration` values on tracked poses currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime.  This is a limitation of the OpenXR API"
