    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed a potential memory corruption issue on Rift when calculating mirror view rects\n- Resolved a potential issue where read-only System Splash Screen images could cause build failures\n- `Shared Depth Buffer` on PC should now work correctly when using `Single Pass Instanced` rendering\n- Resolved an issue where disconnecting a Link device then reconnecting it could result in a black screen with no input\n- Fixed a potential startup crash on Quest when app initialization is interrupted and then resumed\n\n### Known Issues\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.PerfMetrics` entries currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime, which is the default in the 2.x and 3.x versions of the Oculus XR Plugin package\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.AppMetrics` entries currently return `0` on all Oculus runtimes\n- For both of the above, the suggested replacement is to use the profiling tools available via the Oculus Developer Hub: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh-logs-metrics/"
